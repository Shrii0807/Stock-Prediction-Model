# Stock-Prediction-Model

#Overview:

This repository contains a stock prediction model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems, making them ideal for time series data such as stock prices.

#Features:

  Data Preprocessing: Efficiently handle and prepare historical stock price data for training.
  
  LSTM Model Architecture: Implements a robust LSTM architecture for stock price prediction.
  
  Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualization of predictions vs actual prices.
  
  Data Visualization: Visualize stock price trends and model predictions with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

#Requirements:

  Python 3.x
  
#Libraries:

  TensorFlow/Keras
  
  NumPy
  
  Pandas

  Matplotlib
  
  Seaborn
  
  scikit-learn
  
  y-finance

#Dataset:


The Yahoo Finance dataset typically includes historical stock market data, providing a wealth of information for financial analysis and research. 


#Key Features of the Yahoo Finance Dataset:

Date: The date for each record, usually formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

Open: The price of the stock at the market open for the given day.

High: The highest price reached during the trading session.

Low: The lowest price during the trading session.

Close: The price of the stock at the market close for that day.

Adjusted Close: The closing price adjusted for dividends and stock splits, providing a more accurate reflection of a stockâ€™s value over time.

Volume: The total number of shares traded during the day, which can indicate liquidity and market activity.

Ticker Symbol: The unique identifier for the stock, which represents the company in stock exchanges (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
