# Stock-Prediction-Model

Overview
This repository contains a stock prediction model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction problems, making them ideal for time series data such as stock prices.

Features
  Data Preprocessing: Efficiently handle and prepare historical stock price data for training.
  LSTM Model Architecture: Implements a robust LSTM architecture for stock price prediction.
  Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visualization of predictions vs actual prices.
  Data Visualization: Visualize stock price trends and model predictions with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Requirements
  Python 3.x
  Libraries:
  TensorFlow/Keras
  NumPy
  Pandas
  Matplotlib
  Seaborn
  scikit-learn
  y-finance
